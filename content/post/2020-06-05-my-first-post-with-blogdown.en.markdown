Finally I start my blog with blogdown! I am not supposed to take such a long time to establish it (Some Youtubes are teaching how to build it within 15 min, which I have used far more than that due to a minor error!) In fact, the workflow in ![Creating Website with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/workflow.html) has already shown a clear way to do so. However, as a beginner to handle Hugo, Netfily, and so on, I repeated the workflow for many times until getting what I expected, which is the blog you are reading!
