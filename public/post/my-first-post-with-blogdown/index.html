<p>Finally, I am starting my blog with <code>blogdown</code>! It takes a long time to establish it than I expected. Some Youtubes are now teaching how to build it within 15 min, which I have used much more than that! However, that is normal for someone like me without much experience with those Hugo, Netlify, and markdowns. To summerise all the steps I took, I would recommend reading the post from <a href="https://www.storybench.org/how-to-build-a-website-with-blogdown-in-r/">Martin Frigaard</a>.  This post provides very clear and informative descriptions of the same procedures I did. Indeed, it is also recommended to go through the book <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/workflow.html">Creating Website with R Markdown</a>, written by YiHui Xie, so that to understand more about the tools and techniques used in <code>blogdown</code>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I would like to add some tips that I noticed. I hope it may help with other beginners;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pay attention to <strong>HUGO VERSION</strong> required of the template used. When you are connecting your blog to Netlify, you have to provide the &ldquo;Environment variables&rdquo; such that to ensure the version is update enough to run your template.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember to change <strong>baseURL</strong> into the website address on netlify. Otherwise, it would not be able to obtain all data from git, for example the template design used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also for <strong>baseURL</strong>, make sure &quot; / &quot; is NOT missing at the end.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Above are the issues locked me down and took me few hours to find out the reason. Hope these would help the next one to go smoothly!</p>
