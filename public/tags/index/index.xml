			<description>Being a boardgame enthusiasts, I always introduce board games to my friends. Some of them might be another enthusiasts, while some might have an idea that board game is equivalent to chess. Most of time I use my instinct and my understanding on the taste of my friends to decide which game would be provide the greatest fun for us. However, it can be very biased due to my personal preference.</description>

			<title>My first post with Blogdown (Small tips included!)</title>

			<description>Finally, I am starting my blog with blogdown! It takes a long time to establish it than I expected. Some Youtubes are now teaching how to build it within 15 min, which I have used much more than that! However, that is normal for someone like me without much experience with those Hugo, Netlify, and markdowns. To summerise all the steps I took, I would recommend reading the post from Martin Frigaard.</description>
